# Harmonization of Landsat and Sentinel 2 in Google Earth Engine, documentation and scripts

The objective of this work is to document the technical part of my master thesis, named: "Harmonization of Landsat and Sentinel 2 for Crop Monitoring,  a complete stream processing in Google Earth Engine"

I will put here many scripts that I have used, either collected from various sources  or the ones I developed myself.

The scripts are organized not in order of increasing complexity but according to the processing workflow. However, each script or group of scripts is described or demonstrated in the way that you can use them for your own scenario. General format of each title has: Objective, Core Script, Visualziation Checking and References

I will try to cover the remote sensing side also

General introduction about GEE and how to use it is skiped because you can find them in many other places.
