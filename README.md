# Harmonization of Landsat and Sentinel 2 in Google Earth Engine, documentation and scripts

The objective of this work is to document the technical part of my master thesis, named: "Harmonization of Landsat and Sentinel 2 for Crop Monitoring,  a complete stream processing in Google Earth Engine"

I will put here many scripts that I have used, either collected from various sources  or the ones I developed myself.

The scripts are organized according to the processing workflow 

I will try to cover the remote sensing side also

General introduction about GEE and how to use it is skiped because you can find them in many places.
