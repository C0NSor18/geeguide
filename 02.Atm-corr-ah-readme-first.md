# 02.Atmospheric Correction.md
## Objective
Atmospheric correction of Landsat7,8 and Sentinel 2 in Google Earth Engine  
- TOA --> BOA using [Py6S](http://rtwilson.com/academic/Wilson_2012_Py6S_Paper.pdf) via GEE python API
- Generate BOA dataset to your GEE asset

## General Instruction
- GEE support both [Web-based Code Editor](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/playground) and [Python API](https://www.earthdatascience.org/tutorials/intro-google-earth-engine-python-api/). Each environment has its own advantage and disadvantage, we will use only Python API when applying atmospheric correction, all the others tasks will be Code Editor based
- First, please follow this instruction by  [Samsammurphy](https://github.com/samsammurphy/gee-atmcorr-S2) on atmospheric correction of a single Sentinel 2 image using [Py6S](http://rtwilson.com/academic/Wilson_2012_Py6S_Paper.pdf). You will be guided through how to setup GEE python environment, authentication, [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/container-runtime), etc 
- Second, I have modified [Samsammurphy](https://github.com/samsammurphy/gee-atmcorr-S2)'s version so that we can apply it to Landsat 7, Landsat 8 as well (not only a single image), but iterataion on the whole image collection. You should pay attention on the part about turning on/off the Exporting to GEE Asset. Making some tests before turning it on is recommended.
