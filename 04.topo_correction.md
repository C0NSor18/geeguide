# 04. Topographic Correction

## Objective

- 
## General Instruction
- Topographic correction accounts for variations in reflectance (of similar features) due to slope, aspect and elevation. Topographic correction is not always required, but sometimes can be more important than atmospheric correction in mountainous or rugged terrain ([Colby, 1991](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/servlet/linkout?suffix=null&dbid=128&doi=10.1002%2Fecy.1730&key=A1991FJ61200006), [Vanonckelen et al. 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2013.02.003)).
- Implementation of this topographic correction model in GEE by ([Poortinga et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11070831)). The method based on the modified Sun-Canopy-Sensor Topographic Correction as described by ([Soenen et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2005.852480)).
