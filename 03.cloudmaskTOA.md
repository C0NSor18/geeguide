# 03. Cloud Masking TOA Product

## Objective
- Landsat TOA Cloud Mask
- Sentinel2 TOA Cloud Mask
## General Instruction
- Cloud contamination will lower NDVI values, measures like the timing of ‘green up’ or peak maturity would appear later than they actually occurred ([USGS, 2019](https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/landsat-collection-1-level-1-quality-assessment-band?qt-science_support_page_related_con=0#qt-science_support_page_related_con)).
- For Landsat TOA product, BQA band can be used to effectively mask out cloud and cloud shadow pixels. BQA band was generated using [CFMask Algorithm](https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/cfmask-algorithm).
Or ```ee.Algorithms.Landsat.simpleCloudScore()``` in GEE can provide a shortcut to a rudimentary cloud scoring algorithm. Behide the scene of the simpleCloudScore algorithm is described in this [gee script](https://code.earthengine.google.com/dc5611259d9ccab952526b3c2d05ce07).
